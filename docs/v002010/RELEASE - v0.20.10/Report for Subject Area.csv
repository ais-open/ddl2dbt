Voluntary - Voluntary insurance is when you can obtain an auto insurance policy by shopping around for an insurer on your own. If you are considered high risk, you may have difficulty acquiring insurance through this regular voluntary market and be required to obtain insurance through assigned or ceded markets.

AssignedRisk - Assigned risk is a driver of a motor vehicle or class of such drivers who would be denied insurance coverage by insurance companies but are required to be covered under U.S. state law.  This risk is assigned by the state to an insurer.

Ceded - Ceded is a portion of risk which a reinsurer would receive from the previous insurer of the insured. This would let the primary insurance company minimise its risk by passing on the policy that it has underwritten to another insurance provider.  At GEICO, Ceded business refers to policies which we have let another organization reinsure.
